\maketitle

Welcome!

We are the University of Bristol Computer Science Society (CSS). We represent the interests of all Computer Science students at the University. 

We work to support students and staff within our Computer Science community---we organise social events; connect students with opportunities in industry and tackle any issues faced by our members.

We serve a large pool of students, with a diverse range of interests and future career paths, and we'd love to connect you with them!

\section*{Why sponsor us?}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Our department is consistently considered to be \textbf{in the top five Computer Science departments} in the UK.
	\item We do not charge students for membership. \textbf{Anyone studying Computer Science at the University of Bristol is automatically a member of CSS.} We have over 500 undergraduates, as well as more than 200 postgraduates, making us one of the largest societies at the University.
	\item \textbf{We run a number of popular events each year}: hackathons, discussion panels, talks, social events and more. These are a perfect opportunity for you to get involved and promote your brand to our students. We are also keen to help you stage your own event---whether it be a large interactive event or a lunchtime tech talk.
	\item We \textbf{work with other societies} in the University, including:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The University of Bristol Engineering Society (TUBES)
				\item Bristol Electrical and Electronic Engineering Society (BEEES)
				\item Women In Engineering
				\item LGBT+ Engineers
			\end{itemize}
	\item We are in \textbf{constant communication with our members}, through our:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Facebook group (1300+ members including many alumni)
				\item Website \footnote{\url{http://cssbristol.co.uk/}} (recently relaunched)
				\item Twitter account (220 followers) \footnote{\url{https://twitter.com/cssbristol}}
				\item Regular email newsletter (commencing September)
                \item Physical noticeboard in the department (commencing September)
			\end{itemize}
		 We can help you promote your message through all of these channels, as well as branding our major events and society t-shirts.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Sponsor a single event}

We highly recommend sponsoring us for the whole year, as this allows us to prioritise you over the many requests we receive to advertise opportunities and talks. We won't always be able to accommodate these requests---but we can guarantee such opportunities to our main sponsors.

\subsubsection*{Event (\textasciitilde\pounds 300--800 ex. VAT)}

CSS holds many events during the year. We have lots of events planned, including industry-supported activities, CS discussion panels, our annual hackathon, our summer barbecue and much more. Please get in touch to discuss what event you'd like to sponsor. Have your own idea for an event? Let us know and we'll see what we can do!

The cost of this package depends on the expenses incurred by the event you plan to sponsor---for example:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Food and drink
	\item Venue hire
	\item Travel costs for guests
	\item Posters, banner and other publicity materials
	\item Contributions to other expenses when collaborating with other societies
	\item Prizes (for competitive events)
\end{itemize}

In return, you will have the opportunity to:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Name the event
	\item Include your name/logo in any event advertising
	\item Send representatives to the event
	\item Give a short (\textasciitilde 10 minutes) presentation to attendees
	\item Place your name/logo on our website
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Tech Talk (\pounds 250 ex. VAT)}

Throughout the year, we invite members of local industry to present talks about their experience in engineering and about their technical work. Our guests are often Bristol alumni.

You send the presenter, we provide food, drink, venue and faculty-wide advertising. All of our costs are covered by the \pounds 250 fee. 

We usually expect a mixed audience of around 40--50 people, though this varies depending on the availability and interest of students. We recommend holding talks well outside exam season (January and May--June) to maximise attendance. If you'd like any advice, get in touch and we will help you optimise your event.

\section*{How do I sponsor you?}

We'd love to hear from you. 

The best way to get in touch is to email our society vice-president, Codrin Popa (vice-president@cssbristol.co.uk). Alternatively, you can email our society president, Hakeem Kushoro (president@cssbristol.co.uk). Let us know which packages you are interested in, and any questions you might have.
