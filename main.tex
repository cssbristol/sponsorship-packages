Welcome!

We are CSS, and we represent every Computer Science student at the University of Bristol. 

We organise social events; connect students with opportunities in industry and tackle the issues faced by our members. We serve hundreds of students, with a diverse range of interests and future career paths, and we'd love to connect you with them! 

\section*{Why sponsor us?}

\subsection*{Sponsor a single event}

Running an event allows you to talk directly to our students and show them:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Interesting technical problems you work on
    \item What it's like to work at your company
    \item What you're looking for in young engineers
\end{itemize}

Talks and other events are the perfect opportunity to find students who are already interested in your business.

\subsubsection*{Tech talk (\pounds 199 inc. VAT)}

Throughout the year, we invite engineers to talk about their experiences and technical work. You send the presenter; we organise food, drink, venue and advertising.

We usually expect an audience of around 40--50 people (variable depending on the availability and interest of students). 

\subsubsection*{Appathon}

Get involved with our major annual event: the 24-hour appathon.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Theme and name the event
    \item Your representatives on the judging panel
    \item Connect with promising programmers
    \item Leading up to the event, run talks/advice sessions for participants
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Hackathon}

Host or assist a day long Hackathon.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Theme and name the event
    \item Get your hardware or software directly into the hands of students
    \item Run a talk introducing your company
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{CodeLounge}

\textbf{Our new event launching this year!} CodeLounge is aimed at the many Computer Science students who haven't programmed before they start at university. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Help host or design the event
    \item Make an impression on students at the very start of their software engineering career
    \item Introduce your company to our new students
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Something else?}

We run discussion panels, social events and much more for our members. If you would like to partner on the production of any kind of event, get in touch!

\section*{How do I sponsor you?}

We'd love to hear from you.

The best way to get in touch is to email our society vice-president, Codrin Popa (\href{mailto:vice-president@cssbristol.co.uk}{vice-president@cssbristol.co.uk}). Alternatively, you can email our society president, Hakeem Kushoro (\href{mailto:president@cssbristol.co.uk}{president@cssbristol.co.uk}).
